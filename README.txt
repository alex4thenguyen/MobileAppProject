For example, if that letter has a length of 4, the score you will receive is 400 points. There will be a total of 5 levels (with 5 words per level) with letter length gradually increasing starting from 4 letters. If after the time ends and you have not solved all 5 levels, your score will be saved and displayed in "Scores" as the lastest score (score 1).
